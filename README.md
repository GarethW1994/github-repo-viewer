# Github Finder 
   
 #### About
 <hr/>

  Github Finder is a small weight application built to expand my learning around React and Redux. As my learning expands more and more around React + Redux, this app will be improved more and more.
 
 #### Local Installation
 
 <hr/>

- In your Terminal run `git clone git@github.com:GarethW1994/github-repo-viewer.git` cmd.
- Then install node modules with `npm install` cmd.
- After the `node_modules` folder have been added to the project then run `npm start` cmd which will spin up the development server.
  **Note**: If the development server don't start autonomously  `localhost:3000`

#### How to use application:

1. When you open the application the first thing you'd see is a home screen, giving more information about the project. To go to the app click the ``demo`` button.
2. On the search view. Enter a github username in the ``search box`` and click the ``search`` button.

3. On the profile viewer you should see more information about the searched github user.
4. To navigate back to the search view, or to view the user's github or repositories use the navigation bar on the bottom of the screen. <br/>
