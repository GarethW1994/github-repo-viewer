# Github Finder 
   
 #### About
 <hr/>

  Github Finder is a small weight application built to expand my learning around React and Redux. As my learning expands more and more around React + Redux, this app will be improved more and more.
 
 #### Local Installation
 
 <hr/>

- In your Terminal run `git clone git@github.com:GarethW1994/github-repo-viewer.git` cmd.
- Then install node modules with `npm install` cmd.
- After the `node_modules` folder have been added to the project then run `npm start` cmd which will spin up the development server.
  **Note**: If the development server don't start autonomously  `localhost:3000`
